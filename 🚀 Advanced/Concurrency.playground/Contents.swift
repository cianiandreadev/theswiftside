     ## Performance Benefits of async let
     
     Unlike Task { }, which creates unstructured concurrent work, async let ensures that tasks execute efficiently within Swiftâ€™s cooperative thread pool. This means:

     Avoiding excessive thread creation.
     Ensuring optimal CPU utilization.
     Reducing memory overhead compared to manually created tasks.
     Lastly, requests run in parallel, so theyâ€™ll execute faster since one does not have to wait for another to finish.
     
     ## Note regarding async let:
     
     Avoid async let if:

     You donâ€™t need parallel executionâ€”use await normally
     You need dynamic task spawningâ€”use TaskGroup instead
     You need manual task cancellationâ€”use a TaskGroup instead if you want to run tasks in parallel while having the option to control cancellation manually
