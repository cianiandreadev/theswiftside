# 🌌 The Swift Side

> *"Come to the Swift side... we have protocols."*

Welcome to **The Swift Side** – a public collection of Swift Playgrounds where I explore the language, test ideas, and train my dev Midichlorians. This repo is my personal **Swift dojo**, organized for long-term growth, deep understanding, and quick recall.

## 🧱 Project Structure Philosophy

- Each topic lives in a focused, standalone playground
- Structure is by **theme** and **difficulty**, not date
- Shared code (e.g., logging, helpers) goes in `Shared/`
- Topics I want to explore deeper go in `TODO.md`

---

## 🛠 How I Use This

- 🔖 I add `// tags:` inside playgrounds to help with search
- 🧪 I try weird stuff in `Experiments/`
- 🧠 I document surprises or "a-ha!" moments at the top of files
- 💬 I open issues on this repo just to remind future-me of questions

## 🌠 Why "The Swift Side"?

Because Swift is powerful. Because the language has a dark and light side (I'm looking at you, `inout`).  
And because *"fear leads to optionals, optionals lead to force unwrapping, force unwrapping... leads to crashes."*

May your protocols be strong, and your closures never capture self unowned.
